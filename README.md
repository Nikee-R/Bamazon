# Bamazon

Bamazon is a simple command line/terminal application that emulates a storefront using data in a MySQL database. 

#### Overview

This application requires [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/) in order to run. Establish a new connection, make a new query, and copy the Bamazon.schema into it so the application can refer to the data.


### Capabilities

#### Customer

```
node bamazonCustomer.js
```

This will prompt the user to put in the item ID and quantity. The item ID is displayed in the command line/terminal window for the user to reference. Once the user inputs the data, the application will output the price of all units.
